# NLog.Extensions.AzureCosmosTable (removed)

This package was removed from the default branch because it is deprecated, unmaintained, and contains known vulnerabilities. Do not use it.

Use `NLog.Extensions.AzureDataTables` instead.

Last code version is preserved at tag `archive/azure-cosmos-table-2022-01-29` (commit f1c345b490a7353c5fd00d1dde42364d162173ce).
